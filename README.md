Ever wonder if you could model the behavior of complicated systems such as an
ecosystem?

This notebook is a systems dynamics walkthrough that also teaches you how to use
the power of this kind of modeling to understand complex environmental
behaviors.

This notebook uses Vensim for constructing systems dynamics models. The
[`pysd`](https://pysd.readthedocs.io/en/master/) Python package is used to
model the relationships between saltwater marsh grasses, sediment accretion and
sea level rise.
